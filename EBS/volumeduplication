this is to share data with multiple instances at a time
  by using snapshot ewe can achieve this:
    *select the volume that need to be shared and create a sanpshot of that volume
    * from the snapshot we will be creating new volume with existing data
    * this newly created volume will be attched to the required instance.

    volume-->actions->create snapshot->name->create->actions->create volume->size->zone->create->actions->attach volume->instance.

    NOTE: we can not decrese the size of the volume either we can increase or can maintain the same size

    login to instance mkdir aws
    mount volume
    mount /dev/xvdf aws
    go to aws cd aws
    touch files
    unmount and detach
